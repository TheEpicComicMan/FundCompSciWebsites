			<p>The Saturn V is the rocket that took Americans to the moon.<br>The five F-1 engines in the first stage (S-1C) are the most powerful engine ever made.</p>
			<p>The Saturn V had three stages, the S-1C, S-2, and S-4B.<br>The first two and part of the third were for getting the craft into a parking orbit.<br>The third stage was light twice, the second time was to get the craft on a free-return trajectory around the moon.</p>
